# Language Transformer

This project implements the Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need", is a fundamental deep learning model for NLP and other sequence-based tasks.


## Features

- Implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch

- Self-attention mechanism and multi-head attention

- Positional encodings

- Encoder and decoder structure

- Training pipeline with sample dataset

- Visualization of the architecture


## Installation

Install Transformer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/09-prince/Transformer
  
cd Transformer
```

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
