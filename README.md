## Transformer Model from Scratch


This project implements the Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need", is a fundamental deep learning model for NLP and other sequence-based tasks.


## Features

1. Implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch

2. Self-attention mechanism and multi-head attention

3. Positional encodings

4. Encoder and decoder structure

5. Training pipeline with sample dataset

6. Visualization of the architecture


## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
